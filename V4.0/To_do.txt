## Make an annotation database
#### Should be region specific and
#### That is :
#### A number of gene associated annotations
######## Can be localization, tissue type, ect...
#### A number of protein sequence annotations, can be folded, IDR, SLIM,
####


## Remake the homology plotting, so that there is a way to only specify a subset of genes to be plotted
##
## Make a reuse option for database, which will check if it exists, and only do homology of unexisting entries
